InfoChallengeBot is a Discord bot that was build to help manage the UMD Information Challenge Discord server. 
It provides registration and moderation features.

### Configuration

This project uses a dotenv file to pass "secret" information to the application. The most important of which is 
the discord bot token. Information about getting a bot token can be found here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

Note: Some configuration items are Discord IDs, aka "snowflakes". You can find these in the Discord app when you enable "developer mode" for your profile.

This bot requires the following:

Scopes:
- bot
- application.commands
- 
Bot Permissions:
- Administrator

The bot also requires the following Privileged Gateway Intents:

In the future, it may be possible to reduce the number of permissions required for the bot to run.

You'll need to invite your bot to your server with a URL like this:
